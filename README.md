# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Project 
As an analyst for PyBer, I have been tasked with analyzing all the rideshare data from January to May of 2019. This report will visualize the PyBer data to help improve consumer access to ride-sharing services and aid the efforts to provide afforadle rides for low income neighborhoods. 

## Results 
From the data gathered in 2019, we can see the differences amoung the differnet city types that PyBer serves. The chart below outlines these differences, while giving spefic data for each city type. In rural areas, the number of rides is far lower than that of suburban and urban cities. It makes sense as to why the number of rides and drivers is far higher in urban cities, given they are much more populated areas with a greater demand for PyBer service. Becasue of this, we see the number of drivers in much higher and the average fare is lower. Urban cities account for a majority of our business at Pyber, while suburban areas account for a little less than a third of PyBer service. However, we see that the average fare between the three city types is relatively within range of one another, being their is only a $10 difference between rural and urban pricing.

I also have presented the ride-sharinng data in a multiple line chart. From this visualization, the difference in the city types in quite apparent. We see that each city type experienced a small peak at the end of Feburary. During this peak, there were approximately 5 times as many rural rides. However, for each city, business remained fairly consistent over the 5 month period. Overall, the line chart tells us that urban cities contribute the highest volume in total fares and rural areas contribute the lowest. 
While this data is useful, would be beneficial to collect data over a larger period of time to deepen our analysis and provide greater detail into the dynamics of PyBer ride-sharing amougnst different city types.

## Summary 
Based on the analysis of the ride-sharing data, I have a few recommendations to the Pyber business model for addressing disparities amoungst the city types. First, due to simple supply and demand, rural areas will experience a higher fare due to the lack of drivers in the area. To combat this, PyBer could implement an incentive for citizens to become drivers in the area, or for accepting a ride that is more than x amount of miles. Another proposal within rural cities is to place a fare cap on rides, given that these rides have the highest fare and typically the furthest rides. This will also help to serve the underserved areas, while maintaining an above zero profit. Lastly, I recommend PyBer focus its marketing efforts to urban cities and continue to increase use-friendliness, given this city type brings in the most revenue and we provide the most service here. Within urban cities, we should strive for the most affordable and available rides compared to our competitors.
