# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Project 
As an analyst for PyBer, I have been tasked with analyzing all the rideshare data from January to May of 2019. This report will visualize the PyBer data to help improve consumer access to ride-sharing services and aid the efforts to provide afforadle rides for low income neighborhoods. 

## Results 
From the data gathered in 2019, we can see the differences amoung the differnet city types that PyBer serves. The chart below outlines these differences, while giving spefic data for each city type. In rural areas, the number of rides is far lower than that of suburban and urban cities. It makes sense as to why the number of rides and drivers is far higher in urban cities, given they are much more populated areas with a greater demand for PyBer service. Becasue of this, we see the number of drivers in much higher and the average fare is lower. Urban cities account for a majority of our business at Pyber, while suburban areas account for a little less than a third of PyBer service. However, we see that the average fare between the three city types is relatively within range of one another, being their is only a $10 difference between rural and urban pricing.

I also have presented the ride-sharinng data in a multiple line chart. From this visualization, the difference in the city types in quite apparent. We see that each city type experienced a small peak at the end of Feburary. During this peak, there were approximately 5 times as many rural rides. However, for each city, business remained fairly consistent over the 5 month period.
